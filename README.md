# basic_food
A simple HTML/CSS responsive landing page about food.


## Quick Description
I created this project to reinforce my foundational knowledge of HTML **semantics** and **responsive** CSS using **flexbox**. Thus, this is a **simple** website about **food**. I chose the color combination of **orange** and **black** for a **harmonious** aesthetic.

## Did I make the mock-up?
Yes, everything you see has been created entirely from scratch using **Figma** and **Photoshop CS6**. I didn't want to make something extensive because I'm not a designer; it was mostly a simple, small project to work on.
